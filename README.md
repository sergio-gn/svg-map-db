# SVG Map with regions linked to database using json data.
## Features

* Click on each area and pop up the suburb list of the area.
* Uses data from a separated JSON file (Can be stored on database too.)
* Php Loop through each key of the array and output the elements inside.
* Hover with custom css transition for each area
* Can be used with AJAX to made it even more lightweight, but I am using directly for SEO purposes.

Needs to be on a server to work, or at least xampp for localhost.
